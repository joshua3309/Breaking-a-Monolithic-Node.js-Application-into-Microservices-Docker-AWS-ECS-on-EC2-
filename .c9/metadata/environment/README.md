The application allows users to create topic threads and post messages, originally implemented as a single service.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Containerize a monolithic Node.js application\n- Break it into microservices based on business logic (Posts, Threads, Comments)\n- Set up Docker-based local development with docker-compose\n- Deploy services to AWS ECS using task definitions and load balancers\n\n## Architecture Evolution\n\n### Monolithic Version\n- A single Node.js server\n- All application logic in one codebase\n- One failure = full app crash\n\n### Microservices Version\n- *Post Service*: Handles user posts\n- *Thread Service*: Manages discussion threads\n- *Comment Service*: Handles comments on posts\n- *API Gateway*: Acts as an entry point, routing to microservices\n\nEach service runs independently in containers, enabling individual scaling and deployment.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- *Node.js* – Application backend\n- *Express.js* – REST APIs\n- *Docker* – Containerization\n- *Amazon ECS* – Container orchestration and deployment\n- *AWS CloudFormation* – Infrastructure as Code\n- *NGINX* or Express Gateway – API Gateway (optional)\n- *MongoDB / DynamoDB* – Optional backend (based on services)\n\n## How to Run Locally\n\n```bash\n# Clone repo\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/monolith-to-microservices-nodejs.git\ncd monolith-to-microservices-nodejs\n\n# Run monolith (optional)\ncd monolith-app && npm install && node server.js\n\n# OR run microservices with Docker\ndocker-compose up --buildcd ~","undoManager":{"mark":0,"position":2,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":7,"column":0},"end":{"row":14,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["","Hi there!
